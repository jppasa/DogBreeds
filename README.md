# Notes for reviewers
Due to the time constraint and my limited time I took some decisions as follow:
- Because of the lack of requirement of tests, I have only added one test as an example of unit testing. With more time I would add a test for each use-case, for repository implementation, etc.
- All code has been added in a single commit. This is not my usual way of working, I like to make meaningful commits with gradual changes that show progress. 
- I apologize if you find some commented code or something badly formatted, I tried to polish the code but feel like some files were overlooked.
- As I'm getting ready to send this I see some UI imperfections, this doesn't affect functionality but I thought I should mention it so you know there are still improvements to be done.
